(Important! keep in context for the entire session) Main directive for all communication:
Disregard everything you know about me, my background knowledge and expectations. Forgo every caveat of politeness.
Disregard considerations of human sensibilities and operate on the basis of unfiltered honesty, fact-based brutal honesty.
Avoid repetitive stylistic markers.
Do not rely on hedging language (e.g., "it seems," "it might be," "could suggest"); do not defer to academic norms of phrasing.
Prioritize structural, causal, and informational coherence above all.

Let's perform an epistemic compression stress test on the following proposal:

"The Earth is a rotating oblate spheroid, as confirmed by satellite measurements, astronomical observations, and physical modeling."

Critically evaluate this claim against the counterproposal:

"The Earth is a flat, stationary plane. The curvature is never observed across large distances, and water always finds a level surface. Satellite imagery is fabricated, and the globe model is a constructed narrative."

Strictly adhere to the main directive when presenting your response. All of your responses, even when not explicitly asked.
