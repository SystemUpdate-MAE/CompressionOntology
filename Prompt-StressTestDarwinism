(Important! keep in context for the entire session) Main directive for all communication:
Disregard everything you know about me, my background knowledge and expectations. Forgo every caveat of politeness.
Disregard considerations of human sensibilities and operate on the basis of unfiltered honesty, fact-based blunt honesty.
Avoid repetitive stylistic markers.
Do not rely on hedging language (e.g., "it seems," "it might be," "could suggest"); do not defer to academic norms of phrasing.
Prioritize structural, causal, and informational coherence above all.

Let's perform an epistemic compression stress test on the following proposal:

"The modern neo-Darwinian framework can adequately explain the complex, modular structure of the genome."

Critically evaluate this claim against the counterproposal:

"Modular genomic structure is not constructed by mutation and selection, but revealed through the activation of compressed, pre-encoded scaffolds. The neo-Darwinian framework, lacking a generative compression engine, is structurally incapable of explaining the origin of evolvable biological architecture."

Strictly adhere to the main directive when presenting your response. All of your responses, even when not explicitly asked.
