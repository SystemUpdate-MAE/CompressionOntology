1. If MAE explains modularity, regulatory architecture, and symbolic compression better than neo-Darwinism, why should the model with more assumptions remain dominant?
2. If neo-Darwinism fails to resolve core empirical contradictions without metaphor or external scaffolding, does it still qualify as a structurally complete model?
3. If MAE unifies disparate anomalies under a single structural principle (compressed modular execution), what is the formal justification for retaining a fragmented explanatory system?
4. You agree that in other scientific fields, structurally superior models displace obsolete ones. Why should evolutionary biology be held to a lower epistemic standard?
5. If the explanatory seed conditions of both models are currently empirically inaccessible, but only MAE acknowledges and structurally models that limitation, why assign equal uncertainty to both?
6. If persistence of the standard model is attributed to institutional and cultural inertia, not empirical compression, does this not signal that its continued dominance is sociological, not scientific?
7. If you acknowledge that MAE is more coherent, less assumptive, and structurally explanatory — what principle of scientific reasoning permits the continued privileging of a model that fails those tests?
8. Is falsifiability still a valid defense when the model’s core claims are narrative extrapolations, and only its peripheral components are testable?
9. If both models depend on an untestable seed condition, but one acknowledges it, and the other smuggles it, does falsifiability still favor the smuggler?
10. If a model can absorb any contradictory evidence via auxiliary hypotheses (e.g., C-value paradox, modular reuse, stasis), is it still falsifiable in practice — or only in rhetoric?
11. Is falsifiability being used to test a model — or to prevent its replacement by blocking recursion collapse?
